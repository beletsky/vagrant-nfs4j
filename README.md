# vagrant-nfs4j

A Vagrant plugin that brings support of 
[Vagrant NFS Synced Folders](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/synced-folders/nfs.html) to Windows hosts with 
[nfs4j-daemon](https://github.com/gfi-centre-ouest/nfs4j-daemon) under the hood.

This project is heavily inspired by [vagrant-winnfsd](https://github.com/winnfsd/vagrant-winnfsd).
